# Moodle_Spider
A little "Spider" that can help you to download files on Moodle more easily.

An important thing that you should know, if you want to run source code directly, you must install BeautifulSoup and lxml first, you can easily do it using pip or easy_install

pip install BeautifulSoup4 ( it worked)
pip lxml (it doesn't work on my windows)

easy_install BeautifulSoup4 (Don't know if it works)
easy_install lxml ( it works on my computer)

Sorry, too tired, it's 0:49AM not, i will update it ASAP:)
Usage: 
First, you should create info.ini file , first line is your major, second line is your username, third line is your password
Then, you can run the main program, spider.py, The program will download files that you need automatically. Enjoy

Features:

1. Everything can be done Automatically
2. It can detect which file has already been downloaded, and it will skip that.(Alright, i don't want there is only one feature:)

Future work:  (maybe you can help :)

1. Multi thread (increase speed)
2. GUI
3. more intelligent? (Just pick your major, And it will help you download everything. which means i have to let it detect download
page of different major and detect date to make sure it's first semester or second semester.)
4. New ideas always come to me, so why not join me and make this project perfert?

Hope you enjoy it.


Hello, welcome to my github site.
Most of my programs are open-source, feel free to take any part you like.

This Moodle_spider is a little program that will help you to download files more easily, The purpose why i am doing this is that 
our professor upload too many files on the moodle, and sometimes i don't know if i have download them one by one, you know, i am a
lazy student, So i am thinking, why don't i just use a program to do this? 

So here you see the results.
