# Moodle_Spider
Welcome to use this "Moodle spider", this little "spider", will have you download files from Moodle faster and more easily, in the meantime, you will not spend a lot of time sorting them.

How to use it ?

First time ?

just open the exe file, and just follow instructions.

The program will automatically generate a ini file, info.ini to your current directory.

In file info.ini, you will see three lines:

NN
username
password

This file means, a student major in Neuroscience and Neuroimaging  whose username is 'username' and his/her password is 'password', You know this can't happen,just give a example

It's weird to see your password in this way, And i know it's not safe. I will fix it in next version, maybe use someway to encrypt it.



I just tested it several times on my computer, It worked well on my computer, don't know if there will be any different situation...
If something bad happened, first record the error message, and try to reboot program, then, you can contact me at 447903563@qq.com

Hope you will enjoy it!

Features:

1. It can download related files from Moodle automatically
2. It can detect folder structure and put files into right folder.
3. Detect if the file has been downloaded before, and it will skip it.

What's new in version 1.21?

Using python 3.5.1, will have a better speed..... Still very slow.... You can leave it backstage...

And it can report error message in specific function, which will help me to fix it and improve it.

Future work:

Although this program can work will on my computer, there are still some work that can make it more perfect.

1. Multi threading to increase download speed

2. Scan before download, Scan if there are any files in the directory ,Scan if there are any changes on Moodle

3. GUI

4. More intelligent (import time select semester, select major automatically)

5. Security program, need to encrypt password and username. Will update in next version.

6. Change directory, not only in current directory.

7. More interesting idea.

One more thing, this program is open-sourced, and its source code is available to access on my Github, Anyone can use it to build your own work, and also you can help to develop it.
