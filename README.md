# Moodle_Spider
A little "Spider" that can help you to download files on Moodle more easily.

Hello, Welcome to my github site.
Most of my programs are open-source, feel free to take any part you like.

An important thing that you should know, if you want to run source code directly, you must install BeautifulSoup and lxml first, you can easily do it using pip or easy_install

pip install BeautifulSoup4            ( It worked)

pip lxml                              ( It doesn't work on my windows)


easy_install BeautifulSoup4           ( Don't know if it works)

easy_install lxml                     ( It works on my computer)


How to use it ?

First, open 'info.ini' file, and change first line to your major code:

Neuroscience and Neuroimaging : NN (default)

Innovation Management : IM

Public Management : PM

Nanoscience & Technology : Nano

Chemical & Biochemical Engineering : CBE

Omics : Omics

Water and Environment : WE




Please notice there is some upper letter.

Second line is your username to log in Moodle, (Because program also need to log in Moodle and then it can download files)
Third line is your password to log in Moodle.

In file info.ini, you will see three lines:

NN
username
password

This file means, a student major in Neuroscience and Neuroimaging  whose username is 'username' and his/her password is 'password', You know this can't happen,just give a example

I just tested it several times on my computer, It worked well on my computer, don't know if there will be any different situation...
If there is, try to reboot the program and then try to contact me.
My email address is 447903563@qq.com

Hope you will enjoy it!

Harold (Finch)        From Neuroscience and Neuroscience program.

Features:

1. Everything can be done Automatically
2. It can detect which file has already been downloaded, and it will skip that.(Alright, i don't want there is only one feature:)

Future work:  (maybe you can help :)

1. Multi thread (increase speed)
2. GUI
3. more intelligent? (Just pick your major, And it will help you download everything. which means i have to let it detect download
page of different major and detect date to make sure it's first semester or second semester.)
4. New ideas always come to me, so why not join me and make this project perfert?


This Moodle_spider is a little program that will help you to download files more easily, The purpose why i am doing this is that 
our professor upload too many files on the moodle, and sometimes i don't know if i have download them one by one, you know, i am a
lazy student, So i am thinking, why don't i just use a program to do this? 

So here you see the results.
