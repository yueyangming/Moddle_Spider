Welcome to use this "Moodle spider", this little "spider", will have you download files from Moodle faster and more easily, in the meantime, you will not spend a lot of time sorting them.

How to use it ?

First, open 'info.ini' file, and change first line to your major code:

Neuroscience and Neuroimaging : NN (default)
Innovation Management : IM
Public Management : PM
Nanoscience & Technology : Nano
Chemical & Biochemical Engineering : CBE
Omics : Omics
Water and Environment : WE

Please notice there is some upper letter.

Second line is your username to log in Moodle, (Because program also need to log in Moodle and then it can download files)
Third line is your password to log in Moodle.

In file info.ini, you will see three lines:

NN
username
password

This file means, a student major in Neuroscience and Neuroimaging  whose username is 'username' and his/her password is 'password', You know this can't happen,just give a example

I just tested it several times on my computer, It worked well on my computer, don't know if there will be any different situation...
If there is, try to reboot the program and then try to contact me.

Hope you will enjoy it!

Features:

1. It can download related files from Moodle automatically
2. It can detect folder structure and put files into right folder.
3. Detect if the file has been downloaded before, and it will skip it.

Future work:

Although this program can work will on my computer, there are still some work that can make it more perfect.

1. Multi threading to increase download speed

2. Scan before download, Scan if there are any files in the directory ,Scan if there are any changes on Moodle

3. GUI

4. More intelligent (import time select semester, select major automatically)

5. More ideas

One more thing, this program is open-sourced, and its source code is available to access on my Github, Anyone can use it to build your own work, and also you can help to develop it.
